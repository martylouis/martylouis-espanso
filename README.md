# Espanso External Repo Template

This is a template repository you can use as a starting point to host
your Espanso packages outside the Hub.

In general, this template should be used if you plan to share your packages
privately, for example with your company's team.

If you plan to publish your packages publicly, we highly recommend
publishing them inside the [Espanso Hub](https://github.com/espanso/hub) instead.

## Usage

For more information about customizing the repository and using it, please
